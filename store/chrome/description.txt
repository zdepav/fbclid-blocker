short:
Removes fbclid parameter from all links on facebook.

long:
Automatically removes annoying fbclid parameter from any url linked from facebook.

If the parameter is not removed (for any reason) before the link is clicked, this extension will remove it from the url when the linked page loads.

As a side effect it simplifies the links to avoid unnecessary redirects, which can slightly speed-up their loading.

This extension is also available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fbclid-blocker) and its source code is released under GNU GPL 3.0 on [GitHub](https://github.com/zdepav/fbclid-blocker).

permission:
Read and change content of websites - used to remove/hide the fbclid parameter from links/urls as said in the description.

short: Removes fbclid parameter from all links on facebook.

long: >-
  Automatically removes annoying fbclid parameter from any url linked from facebook.


  If the parameter can't be removed before the link is clicked, this extension will remove it from
  the url when the linked page loads.


  As a side effect it simplifies the links to avoid unnecessary redirects, which can slightly
  speed-up their loading.

All code between "/* debug begin */" and "/* debug end */" is removed, after that it is compiled
with tsc --removeComments and then minified using the npm minify package:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/minify

Exact build script can be found in the extension's GitHub repository (file build.sh):
https://github.com/zdepav/fbclid-blocker
Note: the build script requires 7z on PATH.
